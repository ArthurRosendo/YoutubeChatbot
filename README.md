# YoutubeChatbot
WIP Selenium-based (GeckoDriver) youtube chatbot for moderation purposes. Disclaimer: Not even close to being finished.

POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH THIS IDEA:
- I have recently seen that Youtube ocasionally displays messages from another livestream when loading the chat

Required packages:
selenium, grapheme and regex
